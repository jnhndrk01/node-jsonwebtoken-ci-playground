# jsonwebtoken

This is a fork of the excellent jsonwebtoken-library. It was used for demonstration purposes. 
I used it to implement different CI-solutions during the course of the "operating complex it-systems"-seminar at TU-Berlin.
The CI solutions were Jenkins, CircleCI, Github Actions and Github Actions with self-hosted runners. 
My task was to analyse and compare these solutions.
